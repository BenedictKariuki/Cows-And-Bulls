## Description
This project implements the classic **Cows and Bulls** game using Python. The game generates a random 4-digit number (with no duplicate digits) and asks the user to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows":
- **Bulls**: A correct digit in the correct position.
- **Cows**: A correct digit in the wrong position.

The user is given a limited number of attempts to guess the number.

## How to Play
1. A random 4-digit number is generated by the program. The digits are unique.
2. The player tries to guess the number within a set number of tries.
3. After each guess, the program will tell you:
   - How many **bulls** (correct digits in the correct positions).
   - How many **cows** (correct digits in the wrong positions).
4. The goal is to get 4 bulls to win the game.

- Python 3.x
